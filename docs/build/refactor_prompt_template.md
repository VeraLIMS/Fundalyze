# Refactor Prompt Template

## Task
Refactor Code Module

## Objective
Improve code quality while preserving all functionality.

## Refactor Guidelines
- Maintain all original logic and output.
- Improve readability and structure.
- Eliminate duplicate logic.
- Split large functions into smaller, single-purpose functions if beneficial.
- Add or improve function/class docstrings (Google-style).
- Use modern Python features (f-strings, type hints, pathlib, etc.).
- Keep naming consistent and descriptive.
- Apply consistent error handling and logging patterns.
- Preserve compatibility with related modules (e.g., config, API clients).
- Ensure it remains testable and extensible.

## Do NOT
- Change filenames, function signatures, or input/output behavior.
- Introduce external dependencies unless explicitly requested.

## Output
- The refactored code (fully self-contained)
- A brief summary of key changes (e.g., structure, naming, new functions)
